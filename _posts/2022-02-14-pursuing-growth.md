Hola. 👋🏾

Last week I read a statement on my LinkedIn news feed that read “Don’t pursue stability. Pursue growth.”

The statement was part of a longer post, but that part gave me pause. The words resonated with some thoughts and feelings I’ve been having surrounding my software development career, especially recently. One of those thoughts was continuing a blog.

I actually started my first blog last year. I had the idea to use my personal portfolio as a place where I would speak on things I’d learned so far. How to’s and such. That didn’t last long. 😂 This year I decided to give it another shot. Not with how to’s though. Or at least not today.

Regardless, this is an exercise in growth. I challenge you to find one area in life as it pertains to your software development career to grow in. And then do it!

See you next time. 🙃
